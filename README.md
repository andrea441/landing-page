This Landing Page project is a website built as part of The Odin Project curriculum. This project demonstrates fundamental skills in web development, specifically focusing on building layouts using CSS Flexbox.

## Live Demo
Check out the live version of the project here: **[Landing Page Live Demo](https://andrea441.github.io/landing-page/)**

## Description
This project is a practice exercise to test and build competency in:
* Creating a webpage based on a design specification (mock-up).
* Using CSS Flexbox to align and distribute content efficiently.
* Handling standard webpage sections like headers, heroes, and footers.
* Working with external assets (images and fonts).

## Technologies Used
* **HTML5**: Used for the semantic structure of the webpage, utilizing tags like `<header>`, `<div>`, `<button>`, and `<ul>`.
* **CSS3**: Used for styling the website. Key concepts applied include:
    * **Flexbox**: Extensively used (`display: flex`) to manage the layout of the header, card containers, and centering elements.
    * **Box Model**: Managed margins and padding to create whitespace and visual hierarchy.
    * **Styling**: Applied custom fonts (Roboto, sans-serif) and a specific color palette (`#1F2937`, `#3882F6`) to match the design requirements.
